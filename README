This is a scalatra basic authentication with email authentication example.  This was inspired from Jared Armstrongs basic authentication blog post and code examples, with some help from the folks in the #scalantra IRC channel.  The validation emails are messaged over to an actor for sending, so that I could get that out of the webstack and test drive scala's very cool actor model.

Disclaimer:  I am new to scalatra, and scala.  So there may be some things are were implemented in a fashion just short of full retard.  If you see one, drop me a message and enlighten.  Or, fork it and show me whats up.  I started looking at scalatra for an API, and grabbed this as a small project just to play around with the language and get familiar.  An enjoyable evening of hacking on something new...
